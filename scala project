That's a great approach to learning Scala! Project-based learning helps solidify concepts. Here are multiple project ideas categorized by difficulty, focusing on key Scala features at each level.
üåü Beginner Projects (Focus: Syntax, OOP, Basic Collections, Control Flow)
These projects emphasize basic data types, val/var, simple classes, objects, case classes, simple loops/recursion, and fundamental immutable collections (like List, Map).
1. Simple Calculator (Command Line)
 * Concepts: Basic arithmetic operations, match expressions for selecting operations, basic functions, reading user input (scala.io.StdIn).
 * Implementation:
   * Create a simple loop to continuously read input.
   * Use a match expression on the operator (+, -, *, /) to perform the calculation.
   * Implement error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid input).
2. Basic To-Do List üìù
 * Concepts: Case Classes (for the ToDo item structure), Immutable Collections (List or Vector), methods on collections (like ::, filter, map).
 * Implementation:
   * Define a case class for a Task (e.g., case class Task(description: String, isComplete: Boolean)).
   * Use a List[Task] to store the items.
   * Implement functions to: add a task, view all tasks, and mark a task as complete.
3. Quiz Game
 * Concepts: Tuples or Case Classes (to store question/answer pairs), Control Flow (if/else), basic Functions.
 * Implementation:
   * Create a collection of questions and correct answers.
   * Loop through the questions, prompt the user for input, and check the answer.
   * Keep track of the score and display the final result.
üöÄ Intermediate Projects (Focus: FP, Advanced Collections, Generics, Traits, Basic Concurrency)
These projects introduce functional programming concepts (higher-order functions, immutability, recursion), traits, basic generics, and the use of Future for simple concurrency.
1. Simple Data Processor (CSV/Text) üìä
 * Concepts: Higher-Order Functions (map, filter, fold, reduce), File I/O, Generics (processing different data types).
 * Implementation:
   * Read data from a simple file (e.g., a CSV of sales records).
   * Create functions to perform data analysis: calculate the average, find the max/min, group data by a category.
   * Focus on transforming the data using immutable operations and HOFs.
2. Type-Safe Configuration Loader
 * Concepts: Traits (defining a contract for configuration sources), Type Classes (basic idea, perhaps a simple ConfigReader to demonstrate type-safe parsing), Option/Either for robust error handling.
 * Implementation:
   * Define a trait ConfigReader[T] to parse a value of type T.
   * Implement readers for basic types (Int, String, etc.).
   * Use Option[T] to represent configuration values that might be missing, and Either[Error, T] for parsing failures.
3. Web Scraper for Headlines üì∞
 * Concepts: External Libraries (like Sttp for HTTP or Jsoup for parsing HTML), Basic Concurrency with Future (fetching multiple pages in parallel), Pattern Matching with extracted data.
 * Implementation:
   * Write a module to fetch HTML content from a few news websites.
   * Use the parsing library to extract headlines and URLs.
   * Intermediate twist: Use Future.traverse to download a list of URLs concurrently and process the results. Handle failures using Try or Future's error handling.
üî¨ Advanced Projects (Focus: Ecosystems, Advanced FP, Concurrency/Actors, Type System)
These projects involve adopting a major Scala ecosystem (like ZIO/Cats Effect, Akka, or Spark) and mastering advanced type-level features and pure functional patterns.
1. RESTful Microservice with a Pure FP Library üåê
 * Concepts: Cats Effect or ZIO (managing side effects and concurrency), HTTP Framework (e.g., http4s or ZIO HTTP), Type Classes (e.g., defining JSON encoders/decoders with Circe or ZIO JSON).
 * Implementation:
   * Design a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API, perhaps for the To-Do list from the beginner phase.
   * Use the chosen functional effects library to handle the interaction with an in-memory database (or a simple file store) in a purely functional way.
   * Focus on using Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) (like sealed traits/case objects) to model all requests, responses, and errors.
2. Distributed Actor System (Chat) üí¨
 * Concepts: Akka/Pekko Actors (modeling concurrent entities), Actor Hierarchy, Message Passing, Fault Tolerance.
 * Implementation:
   * Build a simple command-line chat application.
   * Each user can be modeled as an Actor.
   * A central ChatRoom Actor manages user registration and message broadcasting.
   * Focus on how Actors communicate via asynchronous messages and how to handle different message types using receive or behavior.
3. Simplified Apache Spark clone (for learning) üíª
 * Concepts: Implicit Conversions or Extension Methods (to enrich data structures), Higher-Kinded Types (HKT) (if you want to generalize operations), Distributed Collection Abstraction.
 * Implementation:
   * Create a simple library for "distributed" data processing (initially just on a single machine).
   * Define a trait DistributedCollection[T] (like an RDD).
   * Implement core operations like map, filter, and a simplified reduceByKey.
   * The advanced challenge is defining the trait to make it truly general using HKTs or to use Type Classes to define how different types can be aggregated.
