üêº Pandas Mastery Project Blueprints
These projects are designed to teach Pandas and its ecosystem (NumPy, Matplotlib) from a practical, problem-solving perspective.

Project 1: E-commerce Sales Cleanup and Aggregation
This project focuses on the fundamental Data Engineering task: cleaning, combining, and structuring messy transactional data.

Concepts to Master:
Data Loading & Merging: Loading data from multiple files (.csv, .xlsx) and combining them using pd.merge() (inner, left, outer joins).

Missing Data Handling: Identifying and treating null/NaN values using isna(), fillna(), and dropna().

Data Type Conversion: Converting columns to the correct type (e.g., string to numeric, object to datetime) using astype() and pd.to_datetime().

Data Reshaping: Summarizing data from transaction level to customer level using groupby() and pivot_table().

Key Deliverables:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate the total spend for each unique customer.

Monthly Sales Report: Create a pivot table showing total sales for each product category across all months.

Cleaned DataFrame: A single, verified DataFrame ready for advanced analysis.

Project 2: Financial Time-Series and Risk Analysis
This project dives into the complex world of time-series data, which is essential for any quantitative analysis or forecasting task.

Concepts to Master:
Time-Series Indexing: Setting the date column as the index using set_index() and ensuring the index is a DatetimeIndex.

Resampling and Aggregation: Converting daily data to weekly or monthly averages using resample() (e.g., df.resample('M').mean()).

Rolling Calculations: Calculating Moving Averages (MA) and volatility (Standard Deviation) over windows (e.g., 20-day, 50-day) using rolling().

Visualization: Plotting price alongside technical indicators (MA, Volatility) using Matplotlib integration (df.plot()).

Key Deliverables:
A time-series plot showing the stock price and its 50-day moving average.

A table showing the annualized returns and volatility for three different assets over the last five years.

A function to compare the risk (volatility) of two different stocks.

Project 3: Text Data Feature Engineering (Reviews/Comments)
This project focuses on transforming unstructured text and categorical data into numerical features suitable for Machine Learning models.

Concepts to Master:
String Operations: Cleaning text data using the .str accessor (e.g., .str.lower(), .str.replace(), .str.split()).

Vectorization Prep: Creating binary flags (boolean columns) based on word presence (e.g., df['Review'].str.contains('poor service')).

One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical columns (like 'Product Type' or 'City') into numerical features using pd.get_dummies().

Binning: Converting continuous numerical data (like age or price) into discrete categories (bins) using pd.cut() or pd.qcut().

Key Deliverables:
A new feature column that counts the number of characters in each user comment.

A DataFrame ready for a classification model, where all original categorical text fields have been converted into numerical features (One-Hot Encoded).

A histogram showing the distribution of comment length.
